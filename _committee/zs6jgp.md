### About Justin 
Hello, fellow radio enthusiasts! I'm Justin, and I've been an active member of the Sandton Amateur Radio Club for the past seven years. During my journey with the club, I've had the honor of serving on the committee for over four years, taking on a pivotal role managing the Repeater Working Group.

Our club, based in the vibrant city of Sandton, is all about the world of amateur radio. We're passionate about fostering connections, exploring cutting-edge technologies, and pushing the boundaries of communication. With our diverse range of repeaters, including VHF, UHF, DMR, D-Star, and EchoLink, we're at the forefront of amateur radio innovation.

As the Technical Guru of the club, my primary responsibility is to ensure that our repeaters are not just operational but are consistently optimized for peak performance. It's a role that requires a keen eye for technical detail and a genuine love for all things radio-related. From maintaining our existing infrastructure to exploring new technologies and implementing upgrades, I relish every moment of the process.

Amateur radio is more than just a hobby; it's a way of life. It's about making connections with fellow radio enthusiasts around the world, sharing knowledge, and experimenting with the latest gear. I am deeply committed to this aspect of our club's mission. Whether it's assisting newcomers in understanding the ropes of amateur radio or working on intricate technical projects, I'm always eager to share my expertise and insights.

Being part of the Sandton Amateur Radio Club has not only allowed me to pursue my technical interests but has also given me the chance to connect with a diverse and passionate community. Together, we explore the vast, fascinating world of amateur radio, and I'm proud to play a key role in keeping our repeaters running seamlessly.

I invite you to join us on this exciting journey, whether you're a seasoned ham radio operator or just getting started. The Sandton Amateur Radio Club is a place where technical expertise meets camaraderie, and I'm here to ensure that your experience is nothing short of extraordinary. If you ever have a technical question or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always here to help and share my knowledge with fellow radio enthusiasts.

Let's continue to explore the endless possibilities of amateur radio together, and I look forward to connecting with you on the airwaves and at our club events.
