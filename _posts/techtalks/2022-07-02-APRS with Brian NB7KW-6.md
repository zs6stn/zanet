Power Hour Tech Talk ... with Brian NB7KW/6

Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) with Special Guest, Brian, NB7KW
Brian speaks several languages, has lived and played radio in many exotic places around the world, and now itâ€™s South Africa's turn.
 
He has some very interesting stories to tell and also inadvertently mentioned that he has extensive experience with APRS, so with just a bit of arm twisting he volunteered to share his knowledge and experience with us. Perhaps we can even convince him to share one or two of his Radio Travel story highlights .
